Hi, Iâ€™m @willik01 

I am a software engineer bringing 20+ years of Product Management experience to solve customer problems with full stack solutions. I started my career as a software developer and I am ready to return to my roots. I thrive on diving into customer pain-points to understand how to develop software that address real problems and improve user productivity and happiness. I believe that communication is paramount and have successfully connected business & development teams to ensure business requirements are addressed efficiently. I am looking for opportunities to apply my past and present skills to make a difference for end users.

My [project portfolio](https://willik01.github.io/willik01/) is a work in process. I would apprecaite any/all feedback.
